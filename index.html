<h1>Web API Progress Prep</h1>
<ol>
 <li>What API are you using?
     <ul><li> Star Wars API: <a href="https://swapi.co/api/">SWAPI</a></li></ul>
</li>
    <br />
<li>A sketch or mock up of your design. 
    <ul><img src="StarWarsAPIPlan.jpg"></ul>
</li>
    <br />
<li>What things you are unsure of how to accomplish.</li>
    <ul><li>We are unsure about how to integrate multiple datasets and how to use url objects to navigate between pages.</li>
        <li>We anticipate a learning curve with sort and filter, but feel like we will be able to figure them out on our own.</li>
        <li>We may encounter a challenge in getting our "more" button to work which will require us to initially show the first 3 objects of a category and then show the rest when the button is clicked. We will also likely have to develop a "less" button that hides the content once shown.
        <li> Though these will be challenges I think we can figure these out on our own or with brief assistance in class or office hours.</li></li></ul>
